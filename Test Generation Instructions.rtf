"Create a test in JSON format with [NUMBER] questions covering [TOPIC/SUBJECT]. Include a mix of MCQ (multiple choice with single correct answer), multi-select (multiple correct answers), and matching questions. Use this exact JSON structure:\
json\
\{\
  "title": "Test Title Here",\
  "questions": [\
    \{\
      "id": 1,\
      "type": "mcq",\
      "question": "Question text here?",\
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],\
      "correct": 1\
    \},\
    \{\
      "id": 2,\
      "type": "multi-select",\
      "question": "Question text (select all that apply)",\
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],\
      "correct": [0, 2]\
    \},\
    \{\
      "id": 3,\
      "type": "matching",\
      "question": "Match the following items",\
      "leftItems": ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"],\
      "rightItems": ["Match A", "Match B", "Match C"],\
      "correct": [0, 1, 2]\
    \}\
  ]\
\}\
\
Important formatting rules:\
For MCQ:\'a0"correct"\'a0is a single number (0-based index)\
For multi-select:\'a0"correct"\'a0is an array of numbers\
For matching:\'a0"correct"\'a0shows which right item matches each left item by index\
Make questions challenging but fair, with plausible incorrect options\
Include [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS if any]"\
Please shuffle the answers so that they are not obvious\
Generate matching questions more creatively, outside of just matching definitions\
Make the questions very difficult, like mid terms level**}
